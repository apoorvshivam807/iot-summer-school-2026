## 📂 Understanding the Repository Structure
To navigate this portfolio easily, here is how my work is organized:
* **Root Directory (`/`):** This main landing page acts as the central index and syllabus guide.
* **Weekly Folders (`/week1`, `/week2`):** These hold the master summary reports for each specific week of the curriculum.
* **Project Sub-folders (e.g., `/led_blink`, `/traffic_light`):** Inside each weekly folder, every assignment has its own dedicated directory containing the raw working source code (`.ino` file) and a detailed step-by-step project report (`README.md`).

## 📂 Laboratory Subdirectories

### 1. 💡 LED Blink (`/led_blink`)
* **Project Type:** Hardware Core Output
* **Core Concepts:** Digital GPIO initialization, `pinMode()` declaration configurations, hardware current-limiting tracking, and fundamental processor delay blocks.
* **System Execution:** Operates as a foundational diagnostic test, toggling a physical digital load state high and low at explicit $1\text{ second}$ operational intervals.

### 2. 🔠 5x5 LED Matrix Display (`/led_matrix_5x5`)
* **Project Type:** Advanced Multiplexed Peripheral Layout
* **Core Concepts:** Common-anode row matrix architectures, 2D font mapping arrays, rapid microsecond row scanning sweeps, and high-speed multi-pin coordination.
* **System Execution:** Sequentially renders font characters A through Z via precise bitwise extractions from binary array data, incorporating microsecond state resets to prevent overlapping display artifacts.

### 3. 🗺️ Sensor Matrix Logic Simulation (`/sensor_matrix_logic`)
* **Project Type:** Core Computational Logic
* **Core Concepts:** Multi-dimensional tracking layout spaces, multi-index loop parameters, conditional bracket indexing offsets, and serial terminal printing layout structures.
* **System Execution:** Executes inside the processor setup envelope, printing a cleanly structured 4x3 multi-node IoT sensor array coordinate layout pattern down to the serial data bus monitor once upon initialization.

### 4. 🌙 Smart Street Light Controller (`/smart_street_light`)
* **Project Type:** Analog Sensor Threshold Automation

## 🛠️ Hardware Stack & Circuit Layout Fundamentals

### Power Distribution
Every circuit this week links standard $5\text{V}$ and $\text{GND}$ output bus channels directly from the Arduino microcontroller board down across the primary breadboard common power rails.

### Component Implementations
* **Resistors:** Clean $220\,\Omega$ resistance configurations protect individual LED junctions against catastrophic thermal failures. Fixed $10\text{k}\Omega$ resistors act as pull-down elements in voltage divider sensor sub-circuits to avoid floating pin reads.
* **Sensors:** Cadmium-sulfide photoresistors vary their raw internal resistance parameters based on changing external lux concentrations, creating a shifting output voltage mapped by the internal Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
