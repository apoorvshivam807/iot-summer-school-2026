# ESP32 BLE Sensor Dashboard

## Description

This project broadcasts DHT11 sensor data over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
every 3 seconds.

The following data is available through BLE GATT characteristics:

- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Timestamp (seconds since ESP32 started)

Compatible BLE scanner apps:

- nRF Connect
- LightBlue
